# Expocal - Exponentiation Calculator

Expocal is a web application designed to quickly and accurately calculate exponentiation using the exponentiation by squaring algorithm. Whether you need to compute large exponentials or simply want a convenient tool for everyday calculations, Expocal provides a user-friendly interface for efficient computation.

## Features

- **Exponentiation by Squaring Algorithm**: Utilizes an efficient algorithm for computing exponentials, ensuring fast and accurate results.
- **Simple Interface**: The user interface is straightforward and easy to use, making it accessible for users of all levels.
- **Single Expression Calculation**: Expocal is currently limited to the computation of one exponential expression at a time.
- **Web-based**: Access Expocal directly from your web browser without any installation required.
